My graph class has functions for handling nodes,
it has built in A* searching.
It also has Depth First Search.
It can also get a node at a position.

The node city simulation uses 4 nodes per tile to simulate a real road.
You can set 2 nodes as checkpoints, then use car spawn points to spawn cars that will use A* to pathfind back and forth
between the checkpoints.

Node city's tile editor is real time. The nodes and tiles will update appropriatly to any changes.
It saves and loads from a file.
